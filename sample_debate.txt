DAVID MUIR: Good evening. Tonight we'll be discussing three critical issues: immigration and border security, the economy and inflation, and foreign policy particularly regarding Ukraine and China. Vice President Harris, let's begin with immigration. What is your plan to secure the border?

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Thank you, David. Immigration is deeply connected to both our economy and our standing in the world, which we'll discuss tonight. On the border specifically, we've taken significant action. We've increased border patrol agents, invested in technology, and worked with Mexico to reduce crossings. What we needed was comprehensive reform, and we had a bipartisan bill, the toughest border security legislation in decades. But Donald Trump killed it because he'd rather run on a problem than solve it.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That bill was a complete disaster. It would have codified the invasion. Thousands of people coming in every single day legally. That's not border security. Under my administration, we had the most secure border ever. We built the wall, we had Remain in Mexico, we had the lowest crossings in history. You came in, you opened the borders, and now we have millions of illegal immigrants pouring in, taking jobs, taking resources, driving up costs. And you want to talk about the economy? The border crisis is an economic crisis.

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Let's talk about the economy then, since you brought it up. Yes, immigration and economic policy are connected. Immigrants contribute billions to our economy, they start businesses, they fill critical jobs. But let's be clear about the real economic issue facing Americans: inflation. We've brought inflation down from over 9% to around 3% while creating millions of jobs. Your economic plan is to give tax cuts to billionaires and impose tariffs that will raise costs for working families by thousands of dollars.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had no inflation under my administration. Zero. Now people can't afford groceries, they can't afford gas, they can't afford housing. And you know why housing is unaffordable? Because millions of illegal immigrants are taking up housing that should go to American citizens. Everything is connected to the border. Crime, drugs, the economy, everything. And on the economy, my tariffs brought in billions of dollars. China was paying. We were finally winning on trade.

DAVID MUIR: Let's stay on the economy for a moment. Vice President Harris, your response to the tariff plan?

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Donald's tariff plan has been analyzed by economists across the political spectrum, and they all say the same thing: it's a national sales tax on the American people. A 20% tariff on all imports means families will pay more for everything from clothing to electronics to groceries. This is not a plan to help working families. This is a plan that will drive up costs while giving more tax breaks to billionaires. My plan focuses on lowering costs, going after corporate price gouging, making housing more affordable, and building an economy that works for everyone.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Price controls. You want price controls. That's never worked anywhere in the history of the world. That's communism. And you talk about my tariffs hurting people, but they worked great. We had the greatest economy ever with my tariffs. The problem is you don't know how to negotiate. You're weak. You're weak on the border, you're weak on the economy, and you're weak on the world stage. Look at what's happening with Ukraine and Russia. That war never would have happened under my watch.

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Let's talk about Ukraine then. Your plan is to surrender Ukrainian territory to Putin in 24 hours. That's not strength, that's appeasement. Putin invaded because he's a dictator who wants to rebuild the Soviet empire. Under our administration, we've united NATO, we've armed Ukraine, we've imposed crippling sanctions on Russia. And this matters for our economy too. If we let Putin win, it sends a message to China, to Iran, to North Korea. It destabilizes the world, it disrupts trade, it threatens American interests everywhere.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Putin never invaded anywhere under my administration. Not one inch. You know why? Because he respected me. He knew there would be consequences. I had a relationship with him. I could talk to him. That's called diplomacy. You've spent over $200 billion on Ukraine while our own country falls apart. Our border is wide open, our cities are crime-ridden, our economy is in shambles, but you're worried about Ukraine's border. Americans are suffering, and you're sending billions overseas. That money should be spent here on American citizens.

DAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, the spending question on Ukraine versus domestic priorities?

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: This is a false choice. We can and must do both. Supporting Ukraine is supporting American security and American economic interests. If Putin wins in Ukraine, the economic consequences will be far greater. Energy prices will spike, global trade will be disrupted, our allies will lose faith in American leadership. This connects directly to what we've been discussing about the economy. A stable world order is essential for American prosperity. And we are investing at home too. The infrastructure bill, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, these are massive investments in American workers and American manufacturing.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The CHIPS Act is a disaster. You're giving billions to these companies and they're not even building here. They're taking the money and running. I brought manufacturing back without bribing companies. I used tariffs, I cut regulations, I cut taxes. That's how you do it. Not with government handouts. And on Ukraine, you still haven't explained how this ends. You're leading us into World War III. You're going to get us into a nuclear war. I would end it in 24 hours. I'd get both sides in a room, and we'd make a deal. That's what a real leader does.

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Donald, you can't just snap your fingers and end a war where one side is fighting for its very existence and the other is an aggressive authoritarian regime. Your 24-hour plan is giving Putin what he wants. And this matters for our economy and our border security too. If America retreats from the world stage, if we abandon our allies, it makes us weaker everywhere. China will be emboldened to move on Taiwan, which would devastate our economy given our reliance on semiconductors. That's why the CHIPS Act is so important, by the way. It's about not being dependent on China or Taiwan for critical technology.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're finally talking about China. I've been tough on China from day one. My tariffs on China were working. They were coming to the table. They were making deals. Then you came in and you gave it all away. Now China's eating our lunch. They're building their military, they're expanding around the world, and you're doing nothing about it. And you want to talk about Taiwan and semiconductors? I had companies building here without the CHIPS Act. I did it through strength and smart negotiation, not by throwing taxpayer money at corporations.

DAVID MUIR: Let's return to the border issue, but in the context of the economy. Mr. President, you've said immigration is driving up costs. Can you elaborate?

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's very simple. Millions of illegal immigrants are competing for housing, driving up rents and home prices. They're taking jobs, driving down wages for American workers. They're using schools, hospitals, services that American taxpayers fund. It's costing us hundreds of billions of dollars. And the drugs coming across the border, the fentanyl, it's killing 100,000 Americans a year. That's an economic cost too. Lost productivity, healthcare costs, destroyed families. Everything comes back to the border. You secure the border, you fix a lot of these other problems automatically.

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: The border is not the cause of all of America's problems, Donald. That's a scapegoat. The real issues are corporate greed, decades of failed trickle-down economics, and lack of investment in American workers. Undocumented immigrants actually contribute more in taxes than they receive in benefits according to multiple studies. They're not taking jobs from Americans, they're filling jobs that employers can't fill. The real solution is comprehensive immigration reform that creates a pathway to citizenship while securing the border. That's the bipartisan bill you killed.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're taking jobs. They're taking housing. Everyone knows it. And you want to give them citizenship? You want to reward illegal behavior? That's why we have this crisis. Because you incentivize people to come here illegally. Under my administration, we sent a clear message: come legally or don't come at all. And it worked. The border was secure, the economy was booming, and America was respected around the world again. You've destroyed all of that in less than four years.

DAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, connecting these three topics, what's your vision for America?

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: It's all connected, David. We need border security with humanity. We need an economy that works for working people, not just the wealthy. And we need to maintain American leadership on the world stage because our security and prosperity depend on it. We can't retreat into isolationism and expect our economy to thrive. We can't demonize immigrants and expect to remain competitive. We can't abandon our allies and expect to be safe. My vision is an America that's strong at home and abroad, that keeps costs down for families while investing in our future, that secures our border while treating people with dignity. That's the choice in this election.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My vision is simple: secure the border, bring back American jobs, make America energy independent again, end the endless foreign wars, and restore American strength and prosperity. We did it before, we'll do it again. But we need to act fast because this country is going in the wrong direction on every single issue we've discussed tonight. The border, the economy, foreign policy, it's all a disaster. And it doesn't have to be this way. We can fix it quickly if we have the right leadership. America first, always.

DAVID MUIR: On that note, let's talk specifically about China's role in all of this. Vice President Harris, how does your China policy connect to the economy and immigration?

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: China is our greatest strategic competitor, and our approach must be comprehensive. Economically, we're investing in American competitiveness through the CHIPS Act, through infrastructure, through clean energy. We're working with allies to counter China's economic coercion. On immigration, there's actually a connection people don't always see, China is the source of precursor chemicals for fentanyl that comes across the border. We're pressuring China to crack down on that. We're tough on China where we need to be, but we also engage where our interests align, like on climate change. This isn't about a new Cold War, it's about smart competition.

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China doesn't respect you. They played you like a fiddle. I had them on their heels with my tariffs. They were losing jobs, their economy was struggling, and they were ready to make major concessions. You came in and you let them off the hook. Now they're stronger than ever. And yes, they're sending fentanyl across our open border. That's why border security is national security. You can't separate these issues. China knows your border is open, and they're exploiting it. They're sending drugs, they're sending spies, they're infiltrating our country. I would shut all of that down immediately.
